# INF01124 - Data Classification and Search

This repository contains the materials for the INF01124 course on Data Classification and Search at UFRGS, taught by professor Jo√£o Comba.

This course covered a variety of topics related to data classification and search, including introduction to complexity algorithms, families/classes of classification methods, sorting algorithms such as insertion sort, bubble sort, and quicksort, intercalation algorithms such as merge sort, linear sorting algorithms such as bucket sort, radix sort, and counting sort, distribution/time constant classification algorithms such as hashing, and search and indexing techniques for text and strings.

In addition to these topics, the course also covers file structures and data file projects, indexing and search in text and strings, and data compression techniques. Throughout the course, students will learn the theoretical foundations of data classification and search as well as practical implementation techniques using programming languages such as Python.

This repository contains the course materials, including lecture notes, assignments, and other resources, for students enrolled in the course. The course is designed for students in computer science and related fields who are interested in gaining a deeper understanding of data classification and search algorithms.

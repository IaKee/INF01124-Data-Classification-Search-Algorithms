# Final project: FIFA Player Sorting

The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset of FIFA 21 players and develop algorithms to efficiently sort and search through the data. The dataset was too large to be uploaded to GitHub, so I had to remove some files, including "players_21.csv", "rating.csv", "tags.csv", "minirating.csv", and "players.csv".

The sorting algorithms implemented in this project include Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Counting Sort. I also implemented binary search and linear search for efficiently searching the sorted data.

The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) created with the tkinter library. The GUI allows the user to select various search criteria and displays the results in a user-friendly format. It also provides options for visualizing the data with charts and graphs.

One of the challenges of this project was dealing with the complexity of the dataset. There were many columns of data for each player, including attributes such as age, position, height, weight, nationality, and more. I had to carefully select which columns to use for sorting and searching, and I also had to account for cases where some data was missing.

Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to apply the sorting and searching algorithms that I learned in class to a real-world dataset.
